It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019 in Hubei. As of 15 July 2020, more than 13.2 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 577,000 deaths. More than 7.37 million people have recovered.\n\nCommon symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.\n\nThe virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, most often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances. Transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.\n\nRecommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use. Health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals.\n\nThere are no vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID‑19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Local transmission of the disease has occurred in most countries across all six WHO regions.\n[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019 \"Wikipedia\")"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## There is an imminent shortage of ICU compared to the amount of patients infected\n![ICU](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AWG6I4CLAQI6VCQ73YKZPPTMXQ.jpg)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Signs and symptoms of COVID-19\nFever is the most common symptom of COVID-19, but is highly variable in severity and presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically ill people not having fever at all. In one study, only 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.\n\nOther common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages. Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions. Some cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations. A decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur. Loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea.\n\nAs is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. This is called the incubation period. The typical incubation period for COVID‑19 is five or six days, but it can range from one to fourteen days with approximately ten percent of cases taking longer.\n\nAn early key to the diagnosis is the tempo of the illness. Early symptoms may include a wide variety of symptoms but infrequently involves shortness of breath. Shortness of breath usually develops several days after initial symptoms. Shortness of breath that begins immediately along with fever and cough is more likely to be anxiety than COVID-19. The most critical days of illness tend to be those following the development of shortness of breath. A minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time. These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not fully known. Preliminary evidence suggested they may contribute to the spread of the disease. In June 2020, a spokeswoman of WHO said that asymptomatic transmission appears to be \"rare,\" but the evidence for the claim was not released. The next day, WHO clarified that they had intended a narrow definition of \"asymptomatic\" that did not include pre-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic (weak symptoms) transmission and that up to 41% of transmission may be asymptomatic. Transmission without symptoms does occur.\n[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019 \"Wikipedia\")"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Coronavirus global Heatmap\n![Coronavirus heatmap](https://www.en.etemaaddaily.com/pages/health/coronavirusupdates/85global.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Projections for ICU Bed Count in India\nOne of the reasons why a massive surge in cases is challenging is that it puts immense pressure on the health care system of the concerned hotspot. We are already seeing this in Mumbai. A small percentage of COVID-19 patients need critical care in the ICU. So more the total cases, greater will be the requirement of ICU beds.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s take a look at the ICU bed projections for key states and cities.\n\nOur projections indicate that all states, including Maharashtra, will have an adequate number of ICU beds when the peak number of cases hits the states.\n\nMaharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are projected to have an excess of 5351; 6484; 2648; and 3320 ICU beds when these states hit their peaks, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Gujarat, West Bengal, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh are projected to have an excess of 2270; 1869; 795 and 1319 excess ICU beds when they hit their respective peaks.\n\nChennai is projected to have 504 excess ICU beds at the time of its peak.\n\nMumbai is, not surprisingly, an exception to the trend, and is projected to fall short by 51 ICU beds when the peak hits the city.\n\nThe numbers for Mumbai and Maharashtra could take a turn for the worse looking at the surge in cases this week. Going ahead, we also need to keep a lookout for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which are seeing a large influx of returning migrants.\n[source](https://www.timesnownews.com/times-facts/article/times-fact-india-outbreak-report-what-the-latest-projections-say-about-the-icu-beds-in-your-state/595787 \"timesofindia\")"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![toi](https://imgk.timesnownews.com/story/ICU_beds_new_ISTOClk.jpg?tr=w-600,h-450,fo-auto)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## In this model, I try to predict whether a confirmed COVID-19 patient will need to use the ICU or not.
